make sure to use settings that saves tookens doing the follwoing (dont use opus 4.6 ifnot needed use lower effort settings if not needed more)
Mutational analysis doesn't seem to work with the subtype filter.
change favicon. see the Favicon v2.png in the following map /Users/fredrikwermeling/Documents/correlate app feb 2026 (färdig)/correlation app
In the mutation analysis table, allow for clicking the gene name and opening the gene effect interface.
mutational analysis, p value "," separated instead of ".". change it. this seems to only be true sometimes, which confuses me. 
in gene effect inspect, hotspot mutation. allow for tissue fiilter
make sure that all exports looks the same as on the screen. I noticed that some where different 
allow for genes to be entered into the network althugh not any correlations found. I suggest that a table could be clicked opening a table (that could be kept open at the same time as looking at the network) where toggle on/of of all genes in the input list is possiuble.
